# Context-Generic Programming Demo in Haskell

This is a demo for using context-generic programming in Haskell developed during [MuniHac 2022](https://munihac.de/2022.html).

The demo follows the examples used in the [context-generic programming guide in Rust](https://informalsystems.github.io/context-generic-programming/).
